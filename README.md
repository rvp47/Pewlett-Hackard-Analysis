############### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - Currently, the company has 300,024 employees, so if all 90,398 retirement-ready workers choose to leave, over 30% of the total workforce would need to be replaced if a ratio of 1 new employee to replace 1 retired employee were necessary. 
 
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - A total of 1,549 workers are eligible for the mentorship program. With only a fraction of the workforce able to participate in the program, there may be a need for restructing the company if it is not possible to recooperate from the "silver tsunami". The requirements of the mentorship program may have to allow for younger workers that are in higher-level positions to be able to participate. Promotions could also be used as a way to replace the retired senior-level workers.
